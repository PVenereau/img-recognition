# Image Recognition

## Introduction
In this project, we use a training set of 10,000 images to train multiple classifying models. Depending on the performance with the test data (also 10,000 images),
we will pick the best model to compete in a Kaggle Competition.


### Timeline

* Friday 16th November: Done with Image Representation and Processing
* Sunday 18th November: Done with implementation of atleast 2 algorithms
